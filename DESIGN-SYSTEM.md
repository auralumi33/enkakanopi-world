# enka kanopi · Charts & Crafts design system

A codified reference for the design language of
[enkakanopi.world](https://www.enkakanopi.world). Named
**Charts & Crafts** — the pairing at the centre of it: *warm surface,
rigorous spine*. Strip the warmth and the logic still stands; strip the
logic and the warmth has nothing to hold.

This document is the **external reference** — the vocabulary, the tokens,
and the attribution line, in one place. It is meant to be borrowed, cited,
and referenced. The *internal reasoning* — how the decisions were made,
what got rejected — lives in [`DESIGN-NOTES.md`](./DESIGN-NOTES.md).

## Attribution (copy-pasteable)

## The design principles (ten laws, distilled)

The full applied record lives in [`DESIGN-NOTES.md`](./DESIGN-NOTES.md).
The load-bearing summary:

1. **One idea per diagram.** No composite metaphors.
2. **Hierarchy is drawn, not shouted.** Line weight, spacing, and rank do the work; size does not.
3. **Warm surface, rigorous spine.** Cream paper, hairline grid, ink type — never dark-mode-for-mood.
4. **The paper stays light.** Only the multi-agent layer earns the night skin.
5. **Colour ranks hierarchy.** Ink for body, canopy green for structure, poppy red for the *one* place the eye should land.
6. **One accent, held back.** The poppy mark appears where a reader must not miss.
7. **The drawing hand is a spec.** Micron-pen line weights (`--w-spine 1.5 · --w-block 1.1 · --w-hair 0.7`) encode drawing hierarchy in CSS.
8. **Every value earns its place.** No tokens exist "just in case."
9. **Growth stage is the axis, not date.** Essays are *seedling · budding · evergreen*.
10. **Openly unfinished.** *Volume I · In Formation* is the frame; nothing is polished into inertness.

## The named idioms (the vocabulary you can borrow)

These have specific names because they compose. When you cite the
language, use the names:

- **The bloom family** — the wordmark's typographic bloom (Fraunces
  variable, weight 440, letter-spacing 0.005em, canopy-medium colour
  `#6f7d5a`, lowercase, held small).
- **The signature garden** — the hero closing block, 5.5rem margin-top,
  keystone quote + name signature.
- **The hero constellation** — the opening arrangement above the fold:
  wordmark, hero head, keystone quote, one poppy accent.
- **The paper stays light** — the standing rule that no dark-mode ever
  ships to the reader-facing site (see [`DESIGN-NOTES.md#the-paper-stays-light`](./DESIGN-NOTES.md)).
- **One poppy held back** — the accent rule: `--poppy` (`#cf4a45`)
  appears exactly where the reader must not miss (focus rings,
  selection, keystone accents, port marks in diagrams). It is a mark,
  not a mood.
- **The night skin** — the *only* dark palette, reserved for the
  multi-agent layer (`/multi-agent` and adjacencies). Uses `--night`,
  `--night-2`, `--gold`. Never leaks to reader-facing surfaces.
- **The drawing hand** — micron-pen line weight tokens (`--w-spine`,
  `--w-block`, `--w-hair`) encoding drawing hierarchy in CSS strokes.
- **The garden's growth stages** — `--seedling` · `--budding` ·
  `--evergreen` — the tokens for essay maturity (Maggie-Appleton lineage,
  re-tinted).
- **The correspondence rail** — the one-door-two-anchors pattern
  behind every essay. A foot-of-essay prose line (the voice, on the
  earned spot) plus a persistent faint rail word in the site footer
  (the findability, everywhere), both pointing at the same `mailto:`.
  Canonical foot-line copy: *"If something here found you — the garden
  keeps a line open — say hello@enkakanopi.world."* Canonical rail
  word: `correspondence`.
- **The maker's-mark seal** — a hand-pressed poppy-red wax mark
  (subtly irregular; the irregularity is the handcraft) + a tiny
  serif caption in the Margiela REPLICA provenance grammar (place ·
  period · hand). Canonical form: *"the garden · summer 07/ 2026 ·
  tended by Fang Rika ·"*. Opt-in per essay via frontmatter
  `seal: boolean`.
- **The garden's motif set** — twenty hand-drawn Marimekko × Japanese-ma
  marks carrying the 円花 (circle + flower) + canopy name-thesis
  across the site. Extended from 10 → 20 on 2026-07-07 (tab pass).
  The colophon ten: *the sheltered bloom · the ensō 円 · the seasonal
  round · the nursery pot · the canopy round · the nested rounds ·
  the three arches · the three pots · the dappled floor · the
  hand-inked seam*. The tab ten: *the pinned cluster · the pressed
  nineteen · the archive gate* (Volume I) · *the word plot · the
  term tick · the citation seed* (Lexicon) · *the apprentice bench ·
  the workbench · the tally mark* (Studio) · *the braided seam*
  (Versions of Me). Delivered as reusable components under
  [`src/components/motifs/`](./src/components/motifs/). Pastel
  palette: `--canopy-soft` primary leaves, `--poppy-soft` held blooms,
  bloom-family sprinkles (lavender · pastel blue · Marimekko yellow ·
  cream heart) at whisper opacity. Each motif is `aria-hidden`,
  reduced-motion safe (no motion). Extend the set only when a new
  name-thesis beat is unaccounted for. Restraint is per-surface, not
  per-page (Law 6 measured at zone level: head · body · foot).
- **The memoria layer** — a fine-line calligraphic register that runs
  alongside the pastel v3 motif set. Named for the *body/webpage as a
  site of memory* framing. Hairline weight 0.6–0.9, tapered ends, low
  opacity, negative space is the star. Two ground variants: cream skin
  (`--ink-soft` + `--poppy-soft` accents, for reader-facing paper) and
  night skin (`--night-ink` + `--gold` accents, for the workshop dark
  ground only). Vocabulary base (18 marks shipped · plus a
  scene-motif hybrid layer of 9 essay-specific scenes commissioned in
  §26, blending Marimekko silhouettes with the fine-line register —
  see the *Scene-motif hybrid layer* note below · extensible per
  essay): cream skin main register (hairline 0.85) — MoonCrescent ·
  VineTrail · ScriptHeart · Greenhouse · BenchTending · PlaceNotFunnel
  · InCompany · FictionFold · WorkspaceRoom · WhiteBear · MergingSeam.
  Cream skin tattoo-flash register (hairline 0.55 · ornamental scatter
  · sparkle glyphs · poppy-soft accent preserved · SUCCESSION §25) —
  TheCurveKept · TheFirstApproximation · FineLineStar · Dragonfly.
  Night skin
  — WorkshopHand · WorkshopMirror · WorkshopSign. Delivered as
  reusable components under
  [`src/components/motifs/memoria/`](./src/components/motifs/memoria/).
  Two placement patterns: **inline** for small doodles that carry a
  phrase within a text line (phrase-replacement register, with
  `aria-label` on the wrapping span), and **block-level** for larger
  concept illustrations that carry a paragraph-scale gesture (above
  or below the phrase anchor, centered wrapper, aria-hidden).
  Extend per essay as narratives require.
- **Scene-motif hybrid layer** (SUCCESSION §26) — larger essay-scale
  scene illustrations that BLEND the pastel Marimekko motif palette
  (soft bloom silhouettes, ground-planes, canopy shapes at 0.68–0.75
  opacity in the four canonical colours: lavender `#b899c9` · coral
  `#e46b6b` · gold `#e8c15a` · slate `#a4b8c8`) with the fine-line
  calligraphic + tattoo-flash register (hairline 0.55–0.85 stroke
  overlays · dashed tangents · script-heart curves · sparkle glyphs
  · Caveat hand-labels via the global `.hand-label` classes). Same
  discipline as the home's `CanopyScene`, per-essay. Delivered as
  reusable components in `src/components/motifs/Scene*.astro`, each
  wrapped in a `.scene-hybrid` figure (max-width 40rem · svg
  responsive · role="img" with title-element for a11y).
  Nine shipped in §26: SceneShelfOfImpossible · SceneRearrangedRoom ·
  SceneWarningAndMirror (Prologue); SceneRoomAtMiddleDepths ·
  SceneInsideLife · SceneAsymptote (Silent Workspace); SceneBearAtEdge ·
  SceneFourGrounds · SceneInBetweenRoom (White Bear). ≥3 per essay
  is the shipping floor for load-bearing pieces; extend as needed.
- **Charts & Crafts** — the whole system's name. Sits at the intersection
  of Tufte's ink-density discipline and the Marimekko-print botanical
  register.

## Tokens (canonical values)

Source of truth is [`src/styles/tokens.css`](./src/styles/tokens.css)
and the machine-readable [`/design-tokens.json`](/design-tokens.json).
The tables below are the human-readable mirror; if there's a mismatch,
`tokens.css` wins.

### Paper & ink (the surface)

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--paper` | `#f7f2e7` | Soft cream ground · the page you're reading on |
| `--paper-deep` | `#efe7d6` | Recessed panels, cards |
| `--paper-dim` | `#f3ecdd` | The nursery's lower light |
| `--paper-edge` | `#e7dcc6` | Hairline dividers on paper |
| `--grid` | `#e5dcc8` | Faint graph-grid line |
| `--ink` | `#2a251d` | Body text — warm near-black |
| `--ink-soft` | `#575049` | Secondary text |
| `--ink-faint` | `#8c8377` | Captions, metadata |

### Poppy (the one accent)

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--poppy` | `#cf4a45` | The single accent — a mark, not a mood |
| `--poppy-soft` | `#e08d84` | Tints, underlines |
| `--poppy-wash` | `#f4e0da` | The faintest fill (selection) |
| `--bloom` | `#cf4a45` | Same as poppy — the botanical name for the accent |
| `--bloom-deep` | `#a83731` | Its shadow petal |
| `--seal` | `var(--poppy)` | Alias — the maker's-mark seal (essay-foot wax mark); held for provenance |
| `--seal-size` | `1.15rem` | The seal's rendered size — a small pressed mark, never a badge |

### Canopy (the structural green)

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--canopy` | `#6f7d5a` | Leaf / sage · structural type + the wordmark |
| `--canopy-deep` | `#4f5b3f` | Shadow side of a leaf |
| `--canopy-soft` | `#aeb896` | Dappled edge |
| `--stem` | `#6f7d5a` | Stalk / leaf, same as canopy |

### Growth stages (essay maturity)

| Token | Hex | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--seedling` | `#8a9a5b` | Just planted, tender |
| `--budding` | `#c48a3f` | Taking shape |
| `--evergreen` | `#4f5b3f` | Stands on its own |

| `--night-line` | `#362f40` | Hairline on night |
| `--gold` | `#d7a45c` | Warm star / focal on night |

### The drawing hand (line weights)

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--w-spine` | `1.5` | The load-bearing stroke |
| `--w-block` | `1.1` | Box / node edges |
| `--w-hair` | `0.7` | Annotation hairlines |

### Type

| Token | Stack | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--display` | `"Fraunces", "Newsreader", Georgia, serif` | Wonky-soft display voice (wordmark, hero heads) |
| `--serif` | `"Newsreader", Iowan Old Style, "Palatino Linotype", Palatino, Georgia, serif` | Body reading |
| `--hand` | `"Caveat", "Segoe Print", "Bradley Hand", cursive` | Annotations ONLY — never body |
| `--sans` | `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto, sans-serif` | Nav links + UI chrome |

### Rhythm

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--measure` | `65ch` | Reading measure — the width the eye can carry |
| `--lh` | `1.72` | Body line-height |
| `--step` | `1.5rem` | Vertical rhythm unit |
| `--gutter` | `clamp(1.25rem, 4vw, 3rem)` | Fluid outer margin |
| `--page` | `68rem` | Page max width |
| `--drift` | `14s` | Motion duration for the drift animation (gated on `prefers-reduced-motion`) |

## The component library (map)

The Astro components live in [`src/components/`](./src/components/). If
you fork the design, the load-bearing ones are:

- **`Nav.astro`** — the aligned nav with the wordmark type contract
  (Fraunces 440, 0.78rem, canopy). Baseline-aligned to the link row via
  `align-items: flex-end` + `line-height: 1`. See
  [`DESIGN-NOTES.md#the-paper-stays-light`](./DESIGN-NOTES.md) and
  the nav-alignment contract in the airlock skill.
- **`Layout.astro`** — the paper-first shell, sets the `--paper` ground,
  loads the fonts, wires the `prefers-reduced-motion` gate.
- **SVG mark family** — the wordmark bloom, the poppy accent, the
  drawing-hand line weights composed via CSS custom properties. The
  glyphs are `.astro` component sources (MIT); the resulting drawings
  as creative works are CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.
- **`content-panel` patterns** — the hairline-bordered `paper-deep`
  cards used for essay tiles. Borrow the pattern freely.

## How to fork responsibly

The design system is meant to be lifted. The site's [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE)
draws the line: code is MIT (fork freely), writing and drawings as
creative works are CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (attribution required, non-commercial,
no derivatives). [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) makes the same
distinction on a per-PR basis.

**Fork-friendly moves:**

- Copy the tokens verbatim into your project. That's what the tokens
  file is *for*.
- Rename the palette if it doesn't fit your brand — you own your fork.
- Use the named idioms as reference ("their signature-garden pattern
  puts breath at the hero close") — attribution appreciated.
- Adopt the drawing-hand token pattern (weight tokens for SVG strokes)
  — a small, portable idea that we didn't invent but did codify.

**Please don't:**

- Republish the essays or reword the prose. Those are CC BY-NC-ND.
- Copy the drawings as artworks (the visual outputs) into commercial
  work without asking.
- Strip the attribution line from a public-facing fork. It costs
  nothing to keep it in a code comment or footer.
